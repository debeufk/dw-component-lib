The `useWindowEvent` hook provides an easy way to register events on the window object.
The event will correctly be register and most importantly unregistered as well.

As input the type of event and the callback is expected

const MyComponent = () => {
	const [moveX, setMoveX] = React.useState(0);

	useWindowEvent("mousemove", (e: Event) => setMoveX((e as MouseEvent).pageX));

	return <div>Mouse Move X Position: {moveX}</div>;
};
```
